/**
 * UltravisorLab-Brand — the application's wordmark / signature.
 *
 * Passed to pict-section-theme as the `Brand` block on the Theme-Section
 * provider. Drives the Theme-Brand-Mark view in the topbar (icon + name),
 * the --brand-color-* CSS variables that themes / app CSS reference,
 * and the Favicon / FaviconDark SVGs available via libThemeBrand.
 *
 * The brand is precomputed at build time. Source of truth lives in
 * Retold-Modules-Manifest.json under this module's `Branding.Palette`
 * field; the `pict-section-theme-brand` CLI generates the deterministic
 * logo + colors and writes them into our `package.json` under
 * `retold.brand`. This file then just hands that block to Theme-Section.
 *
 * To change the look:
 *
 *   1. Edit the Branding block in Retold-Modules-Manifest.json (palette,
 *      DisplayName, Tagline).
 *   2. Run `npm run brand` to regenerate package.json + favicon files.
 *   3. Run `npm run build-bundle` to rebuild the bundle.
 *
 * Curated palette keys: mix, default, desert, ocean, forest, synthwave,
 * twilight, cosmos, carnival.
